### We utilize the API from Peking University Law School's website to get Excel databases for the period spanning from 1949 to 2021 in China. The Python jieba library was utilized to extract keywords from legal texts, employing a method of comprehension to filter these keywords, thereby establishing a foundation for subsequent Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms.
### Bayesian and decision tree classification algorithms were applied toassessthecategorizationofred,black,andgrayvocabulary within legal documents. Red words denote prohibited actions in laws and policies, black signifies regulations that must be adhered to and enforced, while gray represents relatively ambiguous expressions, such as those containing terms like "in principle," requiring legal enforcers to make decisions based on specific circumstances.
### This analysis aimed to explore variations in the red, black, and gray segments over different periods, illustrating the evolution of policy orientations.
